#ASCII Roguelike

I will attempt to make an ASCII [roguelike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike) using C++ and no graphics. 

##Objectives
1. ~~Load the ASCII levels from a level file, e.g. level1.txt, level2.txt, etc.~~
2. ~~Allow player movement using w s a d.~~
3. Have some enemies randomly move around, and allow the player to attack them.
4. ~~Wall physics applies, i.e. players can't just walk through the walls.~~

###Legend:
* D -> Main boss. Worth 100 points. (Try to not to engage him from the start. If your exp is low there is nothing you can do.)
* G -> Main guard. Worth 50 points. Think of something like a mini boss.
* g -> Small guards. Worth 10 points. Easy targets to start with.
