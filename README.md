#ASCII Roguelike

I will attempt to make an ASCII [roguelike] using C++ and no graphics. 
[roguelike]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike

##Objectives
1. Load the ASCII levels from a level file, e.g. level1.txt, level2.txt, etc.
2. Allow player movement using w s a d.
3. Have some enemies randomly move around, and allow the player to attack them.
4. Wall physics applies, i.e. players can't just walk through the walls.
